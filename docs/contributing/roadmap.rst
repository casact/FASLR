2026 Roadmap
============

A minimal working version of FASLR is planned for year-end 2026. Features will include:

* Storage of key figures

  * Selected development patterns
  * Ultimate losses
  * Average types (volume-weighted, medial, etc.)

* Tail factor integration
* Indexing and trending
* The ability to perform an actual vs. expected (AvE) analysis
* Tabs for higher-level entities (country, state) should have summaries that aggregate the values of associated lower-level entities (line of business)
* Deterministic Methods

  * Chain Ladder
  * Expected Loss
  * Bornhuetter-Ferguson
  * Cape Cod
  * Benktander

* Stochastic Methods

  * At least one stochastic method (tbd but maybe Mack Chain Ladder proposed)

* Basic extension functionality

  * Custom charts as an example

* Sample data set enhancements

  * Should include claims emergence so AvEs can be performed

* API reference in the documentation


Nice to have:

* deb that can be installed an uninstalled
* Application tray icon
* Project logo
* Window and tab docking
* Split triangles by loss layer
