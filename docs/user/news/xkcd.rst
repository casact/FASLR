Introducing xkcd Charts
=======================

April 1, 2025

I am pleased to announce that this special release of FASLR introduces `xkcd <https://xkcd.com/>`_ charts to brighten up your day. I know reserving might not be the most exciting part of actuarial science, as illustrated by this graph:

...which is why I have made it my mission to make reserving more exciting for those students awaiting greener pastures in predictive modeling or economic capital modeling. I'm already getting positive feedback as evidenced by this testimonial, which indicates that we're moving in the right direction:

   When I learned that I would be starting my reserving rotation, my heart sank. I have had it up to here with these goddamn triangles! Man, if I were going to be spending all day staring at a computer screen, I would have gone into investment banking instead...or maybe I would have just done LeetCode and gotten a job as a software engineer at a FAANG or something. At least then I'd have an equity stake.

   I was about to give up all hope...but when I heard FASLR was coming out with xkcd  charts, I realized that everything would be okay.

Yeah. I hear you. Well the good news is that introducing `xkcd-style charts <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.xkcd.html>`_ is as easy as a flip of the switch, turning this:
